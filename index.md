# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Baraa Damer and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because, from the start, I liked lab 3's sandwich program, and Lab 5, part 1 refined it further. I used command line arguments, which will be handy for my future career.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1, is another of my favorite labs because I believed it was helpful to know what a programmer can do with loops, which evidently is a lot. The making of the patterns were also cool and they looked nice.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 3, is the last of my favorite labs simply because of the ANSI & ASCII art animation. Although initially confusing, my partner and I got the hang of it. Interestingly, the code called in animations from a URL and had the compiler animate the objects.
